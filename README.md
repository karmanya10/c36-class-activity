html - to create form _
HTML is used to create any content
like a form on a page. HTML is similar
to markdown in some ways.
An HTML contains elements which
define the structure of a page. A
simple html page contains:
- head: where all the scripts and
stylesheets for the page is added.
- body: where all the content of the
page is added.
The body of an HTML page can
contain several different types of
elements:
- h1, h2, h3: display headings of
different sizes.
- input: to collect input from the user.
- button: to display a button.
This model of an HTML page is called
Document object Model (or DOM).
We will be using the p5 Dom library to
create the form
